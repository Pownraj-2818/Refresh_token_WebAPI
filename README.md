Uninterrupted User Experience:

	Usage of refresh token extends the session duration of user and prevents unnecessary reauthentication. For example, if an access token is only valid for 10 minutes, but the user is on the application for 15 minutes, the session may abruptly terminate. This is not ideal and leads to poor user experience. Usage of refresh token is a better approach, which enables new access tokens to be issued without a delay or additional effort
Improved Security:

	The use of refresh token makes it feasible to short the lifespan of access tokens.

The longer the access token remains valid, the higher the risk of it becoming stolen. Pairing long duration of refresh tokens and short duration of access tokens enhances security.
